## Pointmark

Chrome extension to mark a point on a page so you can jump back to it later.

## Installation

One day this will hopefully make it to the Chrome Web Store, but until then:

* Clone the source: `git clone git@github.com:oggy/pointmark.git`
* Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
* Check "Developer mode"
* Press "Load unpacked extension..." and select the source directory.

## Usage

Control-space marks the current point on the page.
Control-Shift-space returns to that spot.

Easy!
